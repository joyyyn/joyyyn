## üëã:cowboy_hat_face: Hi, I'm Joy!
## üå±<b>My Role</b> 
My title is Health Promotion Specialist and I'm happy to be a part of the Health Promotion and Community Engagment team along with Danayi and Ameerah!
I'm about 4 weeks in so I'm sure I'll have a better sense aas I go along and will be sure to update with more deets

## :alarm_clock:My Hours 
Generally, I'm a 9-5 type of person but I'm also really into being up at the crack of dawn so I'm sure there are days where I'll be online at 7am. 
I'm pretty flexible in my work flow, I take brakes when needed and chile do I need them lol

## üìü Call me beep me if you wanna reach me 
I like convos and huddles on Slack best and probably the quickest way to reach me so there is always an opportunity for us to chat!
 I also check emails about 2-3 times a day, pls gimme 24-48 hours to respond.
In an effort to maintain a good balance between work and life and avoid burning out again, I log off at 5pm (unless we have plans, of course!)
I was once told "work is a <i> part </i> of your life, not your <i> whole </i> life" and I haven't looked back since lol

## üé® My Style
I have a background in Community Development, History and Political Science and I have lots of experience working directly with communities co-creating programs and 
services. I also have experience working in borader systems change and advocacy.
I have a very strong vision for Black futures and I believe very deeply in our collective imagination and ability to shape our realities - so I really enjoy working
with people and I love to collab to bring forth our shared visions!
 
I work best when I've got all the tea, the more context the better really so send me alla the planning documents, reports and things - I'm into the history of it all and frankly I am nosy! 
My head is pretty in the clouds so I spend a lot of time thinking, processing and considering all angles before making moves (some would say it's the Libra in me!) but once we've got things figured I'm bout that action.
I spend some of work time doing "offline" or analog activities like writing in my notebook or brainstorming through doodles in my sketchbook.
I'm a pretty laid back person and I'm always down to lend a hand, so feel free to reach out üòÉ

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è My Strenghts
I am a dreamer and creative person and I love the arts: design, cooking, music, painting, cinema - whatever medium really, I'm into it! 
I enjoy learning new perspectives from others, expanding and shaking up the way things have been done. 

## :supervillain_man: Challenges
You know the type of person that says yes to everything and then get overwhelmed later by the amount of things they agreed to? LOL well that is me sometimes, but I'm proud of how
I've grown in setting better boundaries. 

## :blue_heart: I love
I'm a professional hobby-haver, I love taking a class and learning new skills!
I also love cats, cracking jokes and spending time with my dawgs, being in nature, tending to our garden, hanging with my sibling's kids, watching anime, playing video games, dancing,
astrology (I'm a Libra sun, Sagittarius moon and rising - what's your big 3?), competitive board game nights, reality competition shows, karaoke and sharing meals with people I love

## :no_entry: I don't love 
Being rushed or having too much pressure, things that work against the collective good, fresh grapefruit
