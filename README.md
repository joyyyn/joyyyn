## 👋:cowboy_hat_face: Hi, I'm Joy!
## 🌱<b>My Role</b> 
My title is Health Promotion Specialist and I'm happy to be a part of the Health Promotion and Community Engagment team along with Danayi and Ameerah!
## :alarm_clock:My Hours 
Generally, I'm a 9-5 type of person but I'm also really into being up at the crack of dawn so I'm sure there are days where I'll be online at 7am. 
I'm pretty flexible in my work flow, I take brakes when needed! 

## 📟 Call me beep me if you wanna reach me 
I like convos and huddles on Slack, I also check emails regularly so there is always an opportunity for us to chat! 

## 🎨 My Style
I have a background in Community Development, History and Political Science and I have lots of experience working directly with communities co-creating programs and services.
I really enjoy working with people and I love to collab! I work best when I've got all the tea, the more context the better really so send me alla the planning documents, reports and things - I'm into the history of it all and frankly I am nosy! I'm a pretty laid back person and I'm always down to lend a hand, so feel free to reach out 😃

## 🏋️‍♂️ My Strenghts
I am a creative person and I love the arts: design, cooking, music, painting, cinema - I'm into it! 
## Challenges
You know the type of person that says yes to everything and then get overwhelmed later by the amount of things they agreed to? LOL well that is me but I am on the path to setting 
boundaries that are strong as hell. 

## I love
Art, music, cats, gathering with my dawgs, video games, anime, dancing
